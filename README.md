# 🌳 TreeViz (WIP)
**Fast & Interactive Visualization for Large Hierarchies**

> **Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress — Currently supports robust file system traversal  
> with full handling of symlinks, permission traps, and special files.  
> Visualization layer is under active development.

TreeViz is a Python-based tool for exploring massive hierarchical or graph structures.  
It combines efficient recursive directory traversal with flexible visualizations (Graphviz, NetworkX, or GUI frameworks) to make sense of data at any scale.

## 🚀 Features
- Recursive traversal of file systems or arbitrary data trees
- Multiple visualization backends: Graphviz, NetworkX, Tkinter/PyQt GUIs
- Metric overlays (size, file count, timestamps)
- Interactive node expansion & filtering
- Works cross-platform
